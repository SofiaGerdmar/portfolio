# Project Portfolio
About half-way through the Technigo bootcamp we were tasked to make a portfolio. The design was set and the project was mainly to be created using HTML and CSS. After learning of how to use React and styled components, I wanted to make the portfolio more reflecting of my current knowledge. I also changed the design quite a bit to challenge myself.

## The problem
The biggest issue I encountered was how to use polygons and parallelograms in different ways throughout the design. I also tried to implement a carousel in the Featured Projects section, but the only one that behaved the way I wanted wouldn't accept styling the way I wanted to. May be a project going forward.
